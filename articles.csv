Keeping His Head,"Mornings and Johnny Depp? They go together like grunge and greasy hair. Except Depp was best known for presiding over that other end of the morning, the one where the sky is dark and the diet is beer, not bagels. Lately, though, Vanessa Paradis, the French mother of Depp's new daughter Lily-Rose, ""has some kind of hold over Johnny,"" says her friend and biographer Alain Grasset. ""She managed to keep him indoors at night, where previously he might have been out drinking until dawn."" Has Mr. Lout suddenly become Matt Lauer? They seem to be keeping the same hours. ""In Paris, Johnny wanders out in the morning,"" says Grasset, ""to buy fresh bread."" 

Johnny, it seems, has gone from Depp-lorable to Depp-endable. Now 36, he can't stop talking about the wonders of fatherhood and his love for Paradis, 26, an actress-singer who has been famous in France since she was 14. It's as if Jim Morrison lived and bought a minivan: Daddy Depp has no time for trashing hotel rooms (as he did in New York City in 1994, earning himself a few hours in a jail cell; all charges were later dropped) or menacing photographers (as he did with a board in London last January; the police arrested him but let him go with a warning). 

But the man who once boasted to Rolling Stone that he ""did every kind of drug there was by 14"" hasn't given up taking his senses for the occasional wild ride. ""He changes diapers,"" says Rick Heinrichs, the production designer of Depp's visually splendid Sleepy Hollow (which will be the highest-grossing film in Depp's offbeat oeuvre). ""But he describes it in this most heartfelt way. It was really amazing. It was definitely an evolution for him."" Maybe it's harder to act like a kid when you have one: Lily-Rose Melody Depp arrived in Paris on May 27. ""I want everything for her,"" Depp told an October press gathering in New York City. ""I want her to have total happiness. I want blue skies for my girl. I want white, puffy clouds."" To ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY, he was equally effusive: ""I feel like there was a fog in front of my eyes for 36 years. The second she was born, that fog just lifted."" "
Johnny Depp And Meryl Streep “Deals Almost Wrapped” For ‘Into The Woods’ Movie,"Johnny Depp and Meryl Streep filming together and singing. Who can resist? Not Disney any longer. It’s taken 16 months to get off the ground — ever since January 2012, when the studio sent out a press release announcing Rob Marshall (Chicago, Nine) would be directing Stephen Sondheim’s iconic 1987 Broadway musical Into The Woods as a feature film for Disney. A table read was held in NYC this past October featuring Donna Murphy, Megan Hilty, Christine Baranski, Allison Janney and quite a few other Broadway stars. Buzz of Streep’s interest first surfaced last summer and this past week Marshall confirmed in an interview to Playbill that she was “in” to the play the witch. Today Variety reported Depp’s interest. Now I’ve confirmed that Johnny and Meryl “almost have their deals wrapped up for the film,” according to sources. Marshall directed 2011’s Pirates Of The Caribbean 4 (which might have been more palatable as a musical because it stunk as the franchise’s fourquel) so he’s already Mouse friendly. The original musical with music and lyrics by Sondheim and book by James Lapine is about a childless baker and his wife who attempt to lift a family curse by journeying into the woods to confront the witch that put the spell on them. Along the way, they encounter classic fairy tale characters. Depp previously starred in the DreamWorks film version of Sondheim’s dark musical Sweeney Todd which was also the last time he sang on camera. Streep in films had a nice turn warbling country Western in the final scenes of Postcards From The Edge until the longtime Abba fan became the singing and dancing queen of Mamma Mia!. For Into The Woods, Marshall frequent collaborators John DeLuca will produce while David Krane will arrange the music. Lapine penned the screenplay."
Why I Called 911,"I called 911 because she never would. Because every time it happened, her first thought was about protecting him. Because every time it happened, the sweet, loving man we all cared for so much would come back with apologies, profuse, swearing up and down that he understood how bad what he had done was, and swearing never to do it again. We all loved him, but especially, especially her, and she wanted to believe that the behavior wasn't going to last. 

The reports of violence started with a kick on a private plane, then it was shoves and the occasional punch, until finally, in December, she described an all-out assault and she woke up with her pillow covered in blood. I know this because I went to their house. I saw the pillow with my own eyes. I saw the busted lip and the clumps of hair on the floor. I got the phone call immediately after it happened, her screaming and crying, a stoic woman reduced to sobs. 

I understood her heartbreak. He had been my friend, too, a person I loved very much. A person I had once referred to as a brother. A person with whom I had laughed at the absurdity of the media and their spicy claims about my role in their family. A person who came to my rescue in my darkest hour, who I have credited with saving my own life, who I lived with for a year by his invitation while I healed and worked. I knew him to be soft and gentle, with a temper and a dark side, but a golden heart. I didn’t want to believe it either, until I saw the wreckage.

When you call someone your brother, you also commit to calling them out when they are wrong. As she, shaking and crying, described this 195-pound man throwing the full weight of his body into head-butting his 120-pound wife in the face in a fit of rage, I found that an unforgivable line in my heart had been crossed."
"Actors Johnny Depp, Amber Heard finalize bitter divorce","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Film star Johnny Depp’s tumultuous divorce from actress Amber Heard was finalized on Friday, ending the couple’s marriage after months of highly publicized claims by Heard of domestic violence and counterclaims from Depp of financial blackmail.

Court papers filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Friday detailed a splitting of marital assets and an agreement by Depp, 53, to pay a previously announced sum of $7 million to Heard, 30, that she said will be donated to charity.

Heard filed for divorce in May after 15 months of marriage, and days later obtained a temporary restraining order against Depp.

She said in court filings that Depp was abusive to her throughout their marriage, culminating in an argument in May in which he hurled a cell phone into her face and shattered various objects in her apartment.

A lawyer for Depp denied allegations of abuse and argued that Heard was “attempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse.”

“We are all pleased to put this unpleasant chapter in Mr Depp and his family’s lives behind them,” said Laura Wasser, a lawyer for Depp."
Amber Heard drops defamation lawsuit against Johnny Depp’s friend and comedian Doug Stanhope,"Amber Heard has dropped a defamation lawsuit against Johnny Depp’s friend Doug Stanhope after he accused her of “blackmailing” her estranged husband Depp.

In a column published in The Wrap in May, Stanhope, a comedian, claimed Heard had attempted to “blackmail” Depp by “threatening to lie about him publicly in any and every possible duplicitous way if he didn’t agree to her terms”.

Heard’s lawyer, Peter Sample responded to the claims in the column, telling the publication the “allegations against Ms Heard are absolutely and unequivocally false”. He said Stanhope’s claims of blackmail “have no basis in reality and is nothing but the typical celebrity muckraking for profit” and demanded a retraction of the article.

Johnny Depp 'punched crew member in drunken tirade',"Johnny Depp is being sued for allegedly punching a crew member who tried to wrap up filming on the set of his upcoming film, City of Lies. Court documents, filed by Gregg ""Rocky"" Brooks in Los Angeles on Monday, claim the actor, 55, punched him twice in the ribs during a foul-mouthed tirade outside Los Angeles' Barclay hotel. The papers also state the actor ""reeked of alcohol"" and took drugs on set. Depp's bodyguards were forced to remove the actor from the set, it is said. As part of the altercation, Mr Brooks alleges that after Depp had verbally and physically assaulted him, the actor offered him $100,0000 (£75,000) to punch him in the face in return. The location manager is seeking unspecified damages from Depp, director Brad Furman, producer Miriam Furman and the production company Good Film Productions.

BBC News have contacted Depp's representatives for comment. The 14-page filing alleges the altercation, which happened in April last year, began when Brooks attempted to enforce curfew restrictions. According to Mr Brooks, the production team had permission to film until 7pm outside the hotel and until 10pm inside the building, but shooting overran. After getting the curfew extended once, he was then told filming had to stop. The film's director, Furham, allegedly replied: ""Why don't you tell that to Johnny Depp?"" According to the court documents, when Mr Brooks approached an on-site police officer, Depp allegedly intervened, shouting expletives and telling him: ""You have no right to tell me what to do!"""
Johnny Depp Moves Production Company to Disney ,"Johnny Depp’s already Disney’s go-to guy for tentpoles. Now the Mouse House has made room for the thesp’s production banner Infinitum Nihil.

Under a new multi-year first-look deal, Depp will develop film projects he can produce at the studio, expanding his relationship with Disney, for whom he will star in the adaptation of the “Into the Woods” musical and a fifth “Pirates of the Caribbean” adventure.

Infinitum Nihil had previously been set up at Warner Bros., where the shingle produced Tim Burton’s “Dark Shadows” and “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.” Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn was instrumental in attracting Depp’s company to the lot, given his relationship with the thesp while the exec ran Warner Bros. Studios.

The deal with Warner Bros. expired in 2011, and the Disney deal was quietly brokered several months ago.

Depp formed the production entity in 2004 with his sister Christi Dembrowski, who serves as president of the company. “Rum Diary” was the first film to be produced through the shingle. FilmDistrict distributed the movie, based on the Hunter S. Thompson book.

Thesp is currently starring as Tonto in Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer’s “The Lone Ranger” and is set to return to the studio’s “Pirates” franchise with a fifth film set for release in 2015. Up first is “Into the Woods,” which Rob Marshall will helm, reuniting him with Depp. An “Alice in Wonderland” sequel is also in development at Disney."
J.K. Rowling is “genuinely happy” Johnny Depp is in the Fantastic Beasts films. Fans are not.,"After weeks of backlash over Warner Bros.’ confirmation that it had cast Johnny Depp in the sequel to Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, J.K. Rowling has issued a statement defending the move, writing in a note to fans posted on her website that she is “genuinely happy” to have Depp in the role.

Controversy over the choice to cast Depp in the role of villainous wizard supremacist Gellert Grindelwald began to brew last month, in response to an Entertainment Weekly spread previewing Depp’s Grindelwald opposite co-star Jude Law as Dumbledore in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, the upcoming continuation of the Harry Potter prequel series. Depp was initially revealed as Grindelwald at the end of 2016’s Fantastic Beasts, but many fans had hoped Warner Bros. would recast the role in light of renewed cultural conversations about sexual assault and violence against women.

Last year, actress Amber Heard filed for divorce from and a restraining order against Depp, documenting numerous incidents of physical, verbal, and emotional abuse throughout their marriage. Still, despite the serious and public nature of Heard’s accusations, Depp has continued to star and be cast in major films like the Fantastic Beasts sequel — a trend that’s led to growing frustration within a cultural conversation that’s actively questioning how Hollywood and other industries protect abusers."
Angelina Jolie's Hollywood exile,"One of my fondest memories of Pauline Kael was a weekend at her home in Great Barrington, Mass., just a few months before she died. Newsday critic Gene Seymour and I spent two nights catching her up on a fantastic new actress, Angelina Jolie, whom she had seen once in a Mike Newell comedy, ""Pushing Tin"" (1999), and been delighted with. Pauline didn't care much for ""Girl, Interrupted,"" the film for which Jolie won the best supporting actress Oscar (neither did Seymour, who earned a hearty laugh by dubbing it ""Snakepit 90210""), but she howled gleefully every time Jolie reduced one of the other actresses in the film to mere window dressing.

""Those poor actresses,"" she said. ""She's absolutely fearless in front of a camera. This girl would scare the crap out of Jack Nicholson in 'Cuckoo's Nest.'"" Kael's favorite performance was Jolie as the doomed bisexual supermodel Gia in the HBO film. ""My God,"" she exclaimed, ""this girl could play both the Brando and Maria Schneider roles in 'Last Tango'! Where in the world did she come from?""

From where indeed? One of her earlier directors called her ""an extraordinary-looking creature, like some weird, undiscovered orchid."" Never having attended college, Jolie is unencumbered by the jargon-riddled baggage that passes for modern education. The instinctual power of her work is refreshingly devoid of the anesthetizing layers that plague so much American acting. Her responses to everything are visceral and direct, a quality that has earned her a fandom that cuts across class, sex and even political lines. While other celebrities exhaust themselves trying to stay hip, Jolie, who offers no indication in her interviews that she has any knowledge or interest in popular culture, defines hip. Apparently oblivious to the mockery of a large portion of the mainstream press (such as the New York Times, which headlined a story ""Can Angelina Jolie Save the World?"") and even the cheap collegiate cynicism of ""Saturday Night Live,"" Jolie, like the existential man whom French intellectuals used to worship, chooses her own loyalties and responsibilities without deference to conservative or liberal pieties."
Angelina Jolie Speaks Passionately About Refugees & Children,"Taking a break from promoting her upcoming movie Changeling, Angelina Jolie hosted a symposium on international law and justice Friday at the Council on Foreign Relationsthis link opens in a new tab headquarters in New York. “Over the past seven years, I’ve worked with UNHCR and I’ve traveled around the world trying to bring attention to refugees,” she said. “It’s been a remarkable education.”

Jolie, who has visited dozens of war-torn countries around the world, spoke passionately on behalf of the victims she’s met. “I’ve seen refugees return to live among the same people who attacked them,” she said. “They are returning to the same lawlessness that sent them running in the first place. I’ve seen aid workers tear up as they put ladies on a bus and say, ‘I don’t know what we’re sending them back to.'”

Jolie’s remarks personalized the symposium, which featured a discussion by foreign policy experts (including advisers to Senators Barack Obama and John McCain) on the pursuit of justice – using courts, diplomacy, and military action – and its role in international peace. Of particular importance: how to proceed in Darfur and U.S. participation in the International Criminal Court.

“I don’t know if the ICC is the answer. And I don’t know what type of court is, or what it would need to be to make all of us agree and make it strong enough,” Jolie admitted. “But I do know this: No mother who had her children killed in front of her, no young girl sold into slavery, no boy kidnapped and forced to be a child soldier and no young girl like the 3-year-old I met in Sierra Leone, who had her limbs cut off, should be expected to simply forget. No one should have to choose between peace and justice.”"
School funded by Angelina Jolie benefits girls in eastern Afghanistan,"TANGI, Afghanistan, March 15 (UNHCR) - There were celebrations in Tangi last week when a new primary school for girls was opened barely 18 months after Angelina Jolie visited the settlement for refugee returnees and expressed concern about the lack of basic education facilities for children.

The popular UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador provided US$75,000 to build the school in eastern Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province, which was inaugurated on Thursday in time for the start of the school year next Monday. Featuring eight classrooms, four administration buildings, a well and eight latrines, the school can accommodate up to 800 girls in two shifts.

It has been welcomed by parents who are reluctant, for cultural reasons, to send their daughters to schools used by boys. School classrooms built two years ago by the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) provide a primary education for more than 1,300 students, with boys attending in the morning and girls in the afternoon.

But this arrangement was not satisfactory for most parents while the available facilities were inadequate to meet the needs of the growing settlement.

Laila, an outgoing 14-year-old whose family returned to Afghanistan from neighbouring Pakistan in 2008, is among those who will benefit from the new school. “I always had hopes and dreams of going to school,” said Laila, adding that “the hope to become a qualified teacher has revived in me.”

Hakima, also aged 14, has been studying at the existing school, but she explained that her education was being threatened by the lack of facilities. “The school we are presently studying in does not have enough classrooms . . . six of our classes are studying in tents.” she said, adding: “Because of the cultural constraints and security concerns, I had decided not to continue.”"
UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador Angelina Jolie launches centre for unaccompanied children,"WASHINGTON, D.C., March 9 (UNHCR) - Children fleeing persecution and arriving alone in the United States will now have better access to free legal counsel, thanks to the new National Center for Refugee and Immigrant Children in Washington, D.C.

The centre was launched on Tuesday by UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador Angelina Jolie, who last year donated $500,000 to the centre and who has been advocating for more than two years on the issue of unaccompanied children seeking asylum who are detained in the US.

Speaking to reporters at the National Press Club on Tuesday, Jolie said, “The point of all this is, when children cross into this country alone and they’re scared, we must hear them out before we make the choice to either allow them asylum in our country or send them away. It is unethical to not listen to these children. Because without legal representation we are sending children to court to represent themselves in a language that most of them don’t understand. And expecting them to recall accounts so frightening and humiliating, they wouldn’t want to tell anyone, let alone a room full of strangers.”

Each year more than 5,000 children from around the world arrive in the US unaccompanied by adults. Many of these children are asylum seekers who fled armed conflict and human rights abuses in their homelands, including forced recruitment of child soldiers, forced prostitution and servitude, sexual slavery and exploitation, child labour, abuse of street children, child brides and female genital mutilation. Some children come to the US because they have been abused, abandoned or neglected by their parents or caregivers.

A number of these unaccompanied children are apprehended immediately at airports or land borders upon arrival in the US because they lack proper documentation. Others are apprehended after crossing the border illegally. Many are trafficked into the US to work in sweatshops or prostitution rings."
Angelina Jolie to divorce Brad Pitt,"Angelina Jolie has filed for divorce from Brad Pitt citing ""irreconcilable differences"", the actress's lawyer has confirmed. Robert Offer said she filed for ""dissolution of marriage"" on Monday, adding the ""decision was made for the health of the family"". ""She will not be commenting, and asks that the family be given its privacy at this time,"" Offer added in a statement. The couple have been together since 2004 but only married in August 2014. Ms Jolie's longtime manager Geyser Kosinski told E! Online: ""Angelina will always do what's in the best interest of taking care of her family."" It was Pitt's second marriage, having previously wed Friends star Jennifer Aniston, and Jolie's third after Billy Bob Thornton and Jonny Lee Miller. According to US entertainment website TMZ, the divorce papers listed the date of separation as 15 September. It is understood Jolie is seeking physical custody of the couple's six children and is asking the judge to give Pitt visitation rights. Pitt, 52, and Jolie, 41, married privately in the French hamlet of Correns in Provence in 2014. Their children served as ring bearers at the wedding and helped illustrate Jolie's white dress with their drawings."
Angelina Adopts a Girl: And Baby Makes Three,"For weeks rumors have been flying that Angelina Jolie is pregnant, Brad Pittis the dad-to-be, and the overjoyed couple—along with Jolie’s 3-year-old son Maddox—are this close to setting up house as one great big happy family. As it turns out, the talk wasn’t all bunk: Once again Jolie is with child, having confirmed to People that she is finalizing her second adoption. As of July 6, the actress and United Nations activist was expected to have officially signed papers and obtained a passport stamp for a relatively newborn Ethiopian girl who was orphaned by AIDS. “Her name is Zahara,” Jolie told People exclusively. The actress is keeping mum about many of the details concerning her new baby daughter—whose full name is Zahara Marley Jolie—but notes that she and Zahara’s big brother are thrilled. “Maddox and I,” she says, “are very happy to have a new addition to our family.”

The news came as little surprise to Jolie’s close friends, with whom she has frequently shared her desire to adopt again following Maddox’s arrival from Cambodia in 2002. “Angie’s over the moon,” says a source close to Jolie, who was spotted shopping in the newborn department at London’s Harrods department store just a few hours after returning to England from Ethiopia on June 30. “It’s a dream come true. She’s always wanted to extend her family.” And Maddox? “He’s excited to have a new sister,” says the source.

As for the other fella in Jolie’s life, he was by her side during the actress’s most recent trip to Ethiopia on June 28. But if Pitt was clearly playing the role of supportive partner, don’t call him Dad just yet. The adoption “has nothing to do with [Jolie’s] relationship with Brad Pitt,” says the insider. “People are going to try to say it’s about their relationship. It’s not. Angelina’s adopting as a single mother, and she wants that emphasized.”"
Angelina Jolie Is The Most Powerful Actress On Our Celebrity 100 List,"Jolie's ability to shape a national conversation while earning one of the highest paychecks in Hollywood makes her the most powerful actress on our Celebrity 100 list. Jolie ranks 41st overall with $33 million in earnings. Much of that comes from her upfront pay for the movie Maleficent, Disney's new take on the old Sleeping Beauty story. Jolie stars as the wicked queen in the movie, which is scheduled for release next summer.

The second most-powerful actress on our list is newcomer Jennifer Lawrence, who ranks 49th with $26 million. It's hard to think of an actress who had a better year than Lawrence. She started 2012 with The Hunger Games, which grossed $690 million at the global box office, making it one of the highest-grossing movies of the year. Lawrence was paid less than $1 million upfront for her work on the film but she made up for that with a much fatter paycheck to revisit the role of Katniss Everdeen for the sequel, Catching Fire.

Then she won her first Oscar as Best Actress for Silver Linings Playbook (it was the 22-year-old's second nomination). The smaller movie turned a nice profit off its own, bringing in $236 million on a $20 million budget. Lawrence has a slew of blockbusters and art films on deck for the next year includingX-Men: Days of Future Past and American Hustle from Silver Linings director David O. Russell and co-starring Silver Linings star Bradley Cooper."
"Everyone Wants Angelina Jolie's Lips, Kim Kardashian's Eyes, and Brad Pitt's Nose","Many women bring photos of celebrities to their hairdressers, so perhaps it’s no surprise they also bring them to their plastic surgeons. According to the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery’s annual survey, 13% of plastic surgeons saw an increase in requests for celebrity procedures, a big jump from just 3% on 2013. The most desirable facial feature was Angelina Jolie’s lips. Next was Beyonce’s facial structure, Kim Kardashaian’s eyes, and Natalie Portman’s nose.  According to the survey, 18% of the procedures in 2014 were performed on men. Their #1 request? Brad Pitt’s nose.

While Angelina’s full lips certainly add to her appeal, experts warn they may not actually enhance your own. “Celebrities continue to influence beauty ideals from fashion to plastic surgery and although I receive many requests for celebrity features, I always explain to patients that someone else’s features are often not the best choice for their specific face,” says Dr. Andrew Jacono of New York Center for Facial Plastic & Laser Surgery. “The Vectra M3 3D Imaging system is a tool that I use to provide patients with 3D images of what their results could look like. Making sure that the patient and doctor are aligned is imperative.” 

Social media has been a huge driving force in sending both sexes under the knife—especially those under 30. With selfies dominating Instagram feeds, people have become more self-conscious of their facial features. “With the increasing popularity of video sharing services, such as Instagram and Vine, social media content will continue to trend towards video clips, which are not as easily altered as still images,” says Dr. Jacono. “This means that erasing your least favorite feature won’t be as easy as changing the filter on your still shot or photoshopping. In my practice, I saw a 15% increase in requests for Botox and fillers due to self-awareness from social media in 2014 and expect this number to increase in 2015.”"
Angelina Jolie's Son Legally Named Pax Thien Jolie-Pitt,"Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt‘s latest family addition has officially taken their surnames. A Santa Monica court on Thursday approved Pax Thien Jolie’s name change to Pax Thien Jolie-Pitt, a court clerk confirms to PEOPLE. Pax, 3, was adopted from a Vietnamese orphanage in March, joining Pitt and Jolie’s children Maddox, 5, Zahara, 2, and Shiloh, 1. Because Vietnamese law makes it difficult for unmarried couples to adopt, Jolie adopted Pax on her own, but he is being raised by both her and Pitt. In April, Jolie formally requested that the court change her new son’s name to Pax Thien Jolie-Pitt. In January 2006, after Jolie made a similar request in the same court, her other adopted children, Maddox and Zahara, were officially named Jolie-Pitt. In other Jolie news, the actress on Wednesday applauded President Bush’s call to Congress to double the funding for the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief to $30 billion, which includes money to help orphans worldwide. (Jolie serves as honorary board chair of Global Action for Children, an organization she helped launch in April.) “We are all very grateful that the President has made this major commitment to these children,” Jolie said in a statement. “These are the world’s children, and this is the world’s responsibility, and we hope that other G-8 countries will follow his lead. She added, “I will continue to actively lobby on behalf of these children and encourage Congress to follow through on this commitment.”"
Hollywood Praises Angelina Jolie's 'Brave' Double Mastectomy Decision,"Angelina Jolie made a shocking announcement on Monday, revealing that she recently underwent a preventive double mastectomy because of her high risk of breast cancer.

In an op-ed piece she wrote for the New York Times in Tuesday's edition of the paper, Jolie, 37, said that doctors had told her she carries a ""faulty"" gene that gave her an 87 percent risk of breast cancer and a 50 percent risk of ovarian cancer.

She made the decision to have a preventive double mastectomy, undergoing three months of medical procedures, which began Feb. 2 and were completed April 27. The procedures included reconstruction of both breasts with implants.

Leonardo DiCaprio buys Dinah Shore's onetime desert home,"If Leonardo DiCaprio needs to take a breather after his hard-fought Oscar battle, he can retreat to the Palm Springs estate he recently bought for $5.23 million.

Set on 1.3 acres in the Old Las Palmas neighborhood, the renovated 1963 estate designed by architect Donald Wexler was once owned by Dinah Shore, a big band-era singer, television show host and avid golfer.

The 7,022-square-foot Modernist showplace has floor-to-ceiling glass walls, wooden ceilings, a massive stone fireplace and a sunken bar in the living room. Including staff quarters, there are six bedrooms and 7.5 bathrooms. The master bedroom also has a fireplace.

The property, which features a tennis court and swimming pool, previously changed hands two years ago for $4.9 million. News of the sale, which The Times has confirmed, was reported by the Desert Sun.

"Leonardo DiCaprio turns over Marlon Brando Oscar, other gifts allegedly bought with 1MDB funds","LOS ANGELES (AFP) - Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio has confirmed that he has turned over an Oscar won by Marlon Brando, along with other gifts, amid an inquiry into a multi-billion dollar money-laundering scheme involving a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund.

He offered to surrender to US authorities any gifts ""from the parties named in the civil complaint.""

DiCaprio ""initiated return of these items"", said the statement provided to AFP. It said he did so before the US government on Thursday (June 15) filed a new complaint that cited the Red Granite production company behind The Wolf of Wall Street.

""He has also returned an Oscar originally won by Marlon Brando, which was given to Mr DiCaprio as a set gift by Red Granite to thank him for his work on The Wolf of Wall Street.""

US authorities announced on Thursday that they intended to seize more than a half-billion dollars in additional assets acquired with money embezzled from the 1MDB Malaysian sovereign fund, at the heart of a vast international scandal.

Those assets include a US$261 million (S$360.94 million) yacht purchased by Malaysian businessman Jho Low, as well as paintings by Picasso and Jean-Michel Basquiat; and the royalties of Dumb and Dummer To and Daddy's Home.

Those films were also produced by Red Granite, a Los Angeles company co-founded by Riza Aziz, son-in-law of Razak.

US authorities are seeking to recover billions in money and assets allegedly embezzled by businessmen with political connections in Malaysia. The scandal has rocked the Malaysian governing class, exposing Prime Minister Najib Razak to allegations of corruption, which he has denied.

A spokesman for DiCaprio said in a statement that the 42-year-old actor had contacted the US Justice Department last July after learning of a civil action against ""certain parties involved in the making of The Wolf of Wall Street,"" a movie in which DiCaprio starred."
Israeli Leader Asks Leonardo DiCaprio for Help,"Leonardo DiCaprio’s reputation as an activist has reached as far as the Middle East: On his recent trip to Israel, he was asked to help promote environmental conservation and peace in the region, PEOPLE has learned.

Israeli Vice Premier and former Prime Minister Shimon Peres requested a meeting with DiCaprio, 32, within hours of the actor’s March 11 arrival in Tel Aviv with his Israeli girlfriend, model Bar Refaeli, 21, a Peres aide tells PEOPLE.

“The meeting was pleasant and interesting,” says the aide. “Shimon told Leo about his Peace Valley project [a joint Israeli-Jordanian-Palestinian economic development plan] and Leo spoke about [11th Hour,] his documentarythis link opens in a new tab on the environment.”

The DiCaprio and Refaeli were dressed casually – he wore a sweater and backwards baseball cap; she a sweatshirt and jeans. Peres told local newspaper Ma’ariv on Monday: “They called my office and asked to meet me and I immediately agreed. Leonardo apologized for not dressing properly and in order to look fine turned his baseball cap.”

The aide says Peres asked DiCaprio to help promote the stalled Middle East peace process and to further campaign for protecting the environment globally. According to the source, DiCaprio promised to help on both issues.

Reps for DiCaprio confirmed the meeting but had no further comment.

Meanwhile, Israeli police said Thursday they were deciding whether to charge two bodyguards in a scuffle with photographers during DiCaprio’s visit to a holy site on his second day in the country."
HOLLYWOOD STAR LEONARDO DICAPRIO SET TO PLAY VEGETARIAN PHILOSOPHER IN NEW MOVIE!,"It has been announced that Leonardo DiCaprio is set to play Leonardo da Vinci in an upcoming movie about the artist’s life. The movie will be based on the biography of da Vinci written by Walter Isaacson which is expected to come out in October this year.

The role is particularly fitting for DiCaprio as allegedly he was named after the great artist and scientist himself. When DiCaprio’s mother was pregnant with him, she felt him kick for the first time whilst staring at a da Vinci painting in an Italian museum, and decided to name Di Caprio Leonardo right there and then.

But it seems that their names might not be the only thing that the two Leos have in common. Although he has never confirmed it, it has long been suspected that DiCaprio is a vegan.

Earlier this year, he invested money in the vegan snack brand ‘Hippeas.’ He was also involved in the making of pro-vegan documentary Cowspiracy when it was released on Netflix in 2015.

In addition to this, Gwyneth Paltrow has spoken about how Leo influenced her eating habits claiming that he would talk to her about ‘how dirty meat is and how bad factory farming is’. As a keen environmentalist, it would certainly make sense if Leo had ditched meat, eggs and dairy. But can the same be said for da Vinci who lived 500 years ago?"

People's Climate March: Leonardo DiCaprio and other stars join thousands in rally against Donald Trump,"Leonardo DiCaprio and former Vice President Al Gore were just two famous faces among the thousands of people who attended the Climate March in Washington DC amid growing concern over the President's environmental policies.

Photos posted to social media captured actor DiCaprio marching alongside Gore, holding a sign that read “Climate Change Is Real”.

Both men are outspoken critics of the administration’s scepticism of climate change, and they have spent years campaigning for the environment, including at the United Nations.

Gore is reportedly working on a sequel to his 2006 documentary about global warming.

Thousands of people attended the march in the capital on the same day that President Trump was celebrating his 100th day in office – a day which he described to the Associated Press as an “artificial barrier”.

Mr Trump admitted to the New York Times in January that there might be ""some connectivity"" between humans and climate change, four years after he said that it was a ""hoax"" invented by the Chinese.

Yet in 2017 after meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping, it was clear that China was taking a lead on climate change while Mr Trump vowed to bring coal jobs back."
Leonardo DiCaprio may be blacklisted from visiting Indonesia over his criticism of palm oil plantations,"Actor Leonardo DiCaprio may be banned from returning to Indonesia over his criticisms that palm oil plantations are destroying the country's rainforests and endangering wildlife, an immigration official said Saturday.

The Oscar winner made a one-day visit to protected Mount Leuser National Park in northern Sumatra last weekend and uploaded photos to his Instagram account, expressing concerns over species whose habitats are threatened.

""The expansion of palm oil plantations is fragmenting the forest and cutting off key elephant migration corridors,"" he posted. ""A world-class biodiversity hotspot, but palm oil expansion is destroying this unique place.""

Heru Santoso, the spokesman for the Directorate General for Immigration at the Law and Human Rights Ministry, said that DiCaprio used his visit to discredit the palm oil industry and the Indonesian government.

""We support his concern to save the Leuser ecosystem,"" Santoso said. ""But we can blacklist him from returning to Indonesia at any time if he keeps posting incitement or provocative statements in his social media.""

Slash-and-burn practices destroy huge areas of Indonesian forest every year during the dry season, creating haze that pollutes neighboring countries and causes massive economic losses as well as contributing to Indonesia's carbon dioxide emissions. The fires are often set to clear land for agriculture, including palm oil plantations."
How Leonardo DiCaprio became one of the world's top climate change champions,"Leonardo DiCaprio was a climate champion long before the actor wrapped himself in an animal carcass, vomited up raw bison liver, and risked hypothermia for his Oscar-winning role in Revenant.

DiCaprio used his acceptance speech for best actor to urge a global audience to reject the “politics of greed”, and support leaders willing to take action against climate change.

“Climate change is real, it is happening right now, it is the most urgent threat facing our entire species, and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating,” the actor said.

The Oscars was probably the biggest audience to date for DiCaprio’s activism - but campaigners who have worked with the actor said he has been steeped in the issue for years, and is desperate about the need for action.

Over the last few years, DiCaprio has steadily donated his celebrity - and at least $30m in funding according to his foundation - to help advance the United Nations climate negotiations, protect coral reefs and tigers, and spread public awareness about the dangers of climate change. 

The actor has become a fixture at events focused on global challenges since 2014, dropping in at the Davos economic forum to pick up an award last January, and holding a private chat on the sidelines with Ban Ki-Moon, the United Nations secretary general, on the sidelines of the Paris climate negotiations last December."
Leonardo DiCaprio Builds an Eco-Resort,"In what may be his highest-impact leading role yet, the actor Leonardo DiCaprio, the Oscar-nominated “Wolf of Wall Street,” is planning to heal an island.

A well-known environmental activist, Mr. DiCaprio bought Blackadore Caye, 104 acres of wild, unpopulated land off the coast of Belize, with a partner soon after he set foot in the country a decade ago. “It was like heaven on earth,” he said, speaking by telephone from Los Angeles. “And almost immediately, I found this opportunity to purchase an island there.”

Now Mr. DiCaprio has joined with Paul Scialla, the chief executive of Delos, a New York City-based developer, to create an eco-conscious resort there. When it opens to guests in 2018, “Blackadore Caye, a Restorative Island” will feature the trappings of many luxury resorts, with sprawling villas, infinity pools and stunning sunset views.

But the “Restorative” in the title refers not just to the impact the island might have on visitors, but to the island itself. Blackadore Caye has suffered from overfishing, an eroding coastline and the deforestation of its mangrove trees, and the partners mean to put it back to rights.

Blackadore Caye is a 45-minute boat ride from Philip S. W. Goldson International Airport in Belize City and a 15-minute boat ride from San Pedro, the nearest big town. The island has been used for hundreds of years, according to Juan Rovalo, a biologist who leads a team of scientists studying the caye.

It was a popular spot for fishermen, who would stop on their way to markets in Mexico and cut mangrove, using the wood for fires to smoke their catch and the conch that they took from the reef, littering the island with thousands of empty shells. More recently, he said, the island’s once plentiful palm trees have been uprooted and used to landscape the grounds of hotels in San Pedro."
"Malaysia money laundering probe: Leonardo DiCaprio returns Brando's Oscar, Picasso painting ","LOS ANGELES: Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio has returned Marlon Brando's best actor Oscar statuette to the US government as part of an investigation into the money laundering by a state-owned Malaysian investment fund.

DiCaprio received Brando's Oscar and other artefacts as his 38th birthday gift in 2012 from business associates at Red Granite Pictures, which also funded his film ""Wolf of Wall Street"".

The 42-year-old actor has voluntarily handed over the Oscar statuette and other expensive gifts amid investigation into a USD 3.5-billion money-laundering scheme. 

Authorities from the US Department of Justice suspect that Red Granite co-founder Riza Aziz may have helped his stepfather, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, embezzle USD 4.5 billion from a political development scheme, reported Los Angeles Times.

The misappropriated funds were used to form the production company that funded the Martin Scorsese-directed movie, about a corrupt stockbroker.

The laundered money was used to fund a lavish lifestyle, including purchases of artwork and jewellery, the acquisition of luxury real estate and luxury yachts, the payment of gambling expenses, and the hiring of musicians and celebrities to attend parties.

The multi-million-dollar artworks in question include a Picasso painting, a photograph by Diane Arbus and a Jean- Michel Basquiat collage, which were supposedly gifted to DiCaprio by Jho Low, Red Granite's purported financier.

The actor had accepted the art with the intention of auctioning off the pieces to raise money for his charitable foundation, according to his spokesperson said.

DiCaprio has already given the art and the Oscar to US authorities, the spokesperson added.

And though there are no plans at this time for DiCaprio to forfeit the money he received for his work on ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" his spokesperson noted that the actor intends to offer the return of any ""gifts or donations"" under speculation with ""the aid and instruction of the government."""
